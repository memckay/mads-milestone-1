    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Clean raw data from the [Bronze](./1_bronze.ipynb) layer to create a unified data asset. Here we engage in comprehensive cleaning, exploratory analysis, and imputation strategies. This process creates a clean dataset which is suitable for downstream analytics and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Processes:**\n",
    "- **Data Integration**: Combine and standardize data from multiple regional sources\n",
    "- **Exploratory Analysis**: Visual analysis to understand data patterns and inform imputation strategies  \n",
    "- **Planned Imputation**: Apply breed-specific probabilistic imputation for missing demographic data\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Validate completeness and consistency of final dataset\n",
    "- **Materialization**: Create analysis-ready dataset for Gold\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformations Applied:**\n",
    "- **Standardize** column names to lowercase snake_case\n",
    "- **Harmonize** categorical values across data sources\n",
    "- **Compute** age from intake dates and birth dates where available\n",
    "- **Impute** missing ages using species-specific median values\n",
    "- **Impute** missing sex and primary color using breed-based probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "This data will be used when creating [Gold](./3_gold.ipynb), where tailored data assets will be created to efficiently answer research questions.\n",
