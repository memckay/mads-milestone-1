    "# Gold Data Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**  \n",
    "Transform the curated [SILVER_DF](./2_silver.ipynb) dataset into information-ready assets optimized for reporting, dashboards, and analytics consumption. Gold tables and views are structured to answer specific questions efficiently, with pre-computed metrics and clear dimensional relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformations Applied:**\n",
    "- **Aggregate** key metrics over animal shelter dimensions (monthly intake counts, outcome rates by breed)  \n",
    "- **Compute** derived KPIs (average age at intake, percent adoption rate)  \n",
    "- **Build** visualizations (charts, dashboards) off these Gold-layer models to surface insights \n",
    "\n",
    "These Gold-layer assets deliver high performance and an intuitive schema for end users, supporting ad-hoc exploration, charting, and executive summaries.\n",
