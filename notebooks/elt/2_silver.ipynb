    "## Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Date Anomalies**  \n",
    "   - Identify any `intake_date` or `outcome_date` > today’s date  \n",
    "     - ▢ Flag them with a boolean column (e.g. `is_future_intake`)  \n",
    "     - ▢ Decide whether to drop or correct (e.g. trim off future records)  \n",
    "   - Check for missing or null dates  \n",
    "     - ▢ Log how many, then drop or impute if necessary  \n",
    "   - Validate date formats & dtypes  \n",
    "     - ▢ Ensure all date columns are `datetime64`  \n",
    "     - ▢ Normalize any stray string–dates via `pd.to_datetime(errors='coerce')`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clean the `age` Column**  \n",
    "   - Extract number + unit from raw string (e.g. “7 MONTHS”, “2 WEEKS”)  \n",
    "     - ▢ Write a parser (regex or split) to separate `value` and `unit`  \n",
    "   - Convert to a consistent numeric metric (`age_years`)  \n",
    "     - ▢ DAYS → days/365  \n",
    "     - ▢ WEEKS → (weeks×7)/365  \n",
    "     - ▢ MONTHS → months/12  \n",
    "     - ▢ YEARS → years  \n",
    "   - Handle invalid or missing formats  \n",
    "     - ▢ Coerce unrecognized strings to `NaN`  \n",
    "     - ▢ Optionally, add an `age_was_missing` indicator  \n",
    "   - Add & validate new column  \n",
    "     - ▢ Create `age_years` in the DataFrame  \n",
    "     - ▢ Inspect its distribution (`.describe()`, histograms) for outliers"
